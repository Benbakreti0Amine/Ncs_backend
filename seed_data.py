🎯 SMART RELAY POINT OPTIMIZATION ALGORITHM
===========================================

This algorithm finds the MINIMUM number of relay points that provide MAXIMUM coverage
while ensuring all points are accessible via public transport.

Core Concept: Instead of placing relay points randomly, we use AI to:
1. Analyze population density
2. Find transport hubs (tram/bus stations)
3. Calculate optimal coverage with minimum points
4. Ensure no citizen is >2km from a relay point
